| **Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set** by Jon Duckett | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY ABSOLUTE TOP PICK FOR WEBDEV.** This is a set that combines 2 books for a cheaper price. _Both books are excellent: very visual, easy to look up things in, and get straight to the point without a lot of blah blah._ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites** by Jon Duckett | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118871642/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY TOP PICK FOR HTML\/CSS.** Great book that is very visually oriented. It’s very easy to look through, especially if you are in a hurry._ It’s also very concise and to the point._ |
| **Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction**by Steve McConnell | **[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY TOP PICK FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL.** This book is a timeless classic that will teach you the "art and science of software construction". It will _mature_ you as a software developer and how you approach software solutions you yourself develop. _In my opinion, required reading for any software developer, experienced or beginner._ |
| **Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship**by Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin | **[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY TOP PICK FOR EVERYDAY CODING PRACTICES.** This book is another classic similar to "Code Complete" book, but goes into the details of how to actually do the coding well. While the "Code Complete" book will mature you in general software approaches, this one zones in on day to day coding practices. I've seen a lot of software that was easier to just dump and re-write from scratch than update. All because the original developers did not follow the basic principles this book advocates. What does "good code" or "clean code" even mean? Read this book and find out! _In my opinion, required reading for any software developer,experienced or beginner._ |
| **Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual** by John Sonmez | **[Buy on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY TOP PICK FOR GENERAL CAREER GUIDANCE FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.** I just recently finished this book and it's absolutely invaluable advice for any software developer, especially someone starting out. It's an "eye opener". It's an easy read \(or listen to audio version\). It provides a holistic approach to life in general with a twist that's applicable to software developers. Like in any profession, in software there is more to_being successful_ than just the skill of writing good code. The book goes through tons and tons of topics from different types of software jobs \(with their advantages and disadvantages\) to _drastically increasing your productivity_ & how to form good habits. It's definitely going on my list of_"Required reading for any software developer, experienced or beginner."_ |
| **Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics** by Jennifer Niederst Robbins | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449319270/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | A fairly comprehensive book that talks about the code AND the design aspect of web page development. |
| **Learning Web App Development**by Semmy Purewal | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Web-Development-Semmy-Purewal/dp/1449370195?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | A student found this book and states that "its close to what is taught in this course". Looks like a great book from first glance and does sound close to what we cover in the course. |
| **Mastering Sublime Text**by Dan Peleg | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Sublime-Text-Dan-Peleg/dp/1849698422/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | Clear, step by step instructions. _Covers Sublime Text 3!_ |
| **Pragmatic Guide to Git**by Travis Swicegood | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Guide-Git-Guides/dp/1934356727/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY TOP PICK FOR GIT.** I am a BIG fan of pretty much any Pragmatic programming series book. This one is great as well! _Explains the concepts well, so you are not just memorizing commands._ |
| **Pro Git** by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-Git-Scott-Chacon/dp/1484200772/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | Explains things pretty well. You can **read it for free** online [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). |
| **JavaScript: The Definitive Guide: Activate Your Web Pages** by David Flanagan | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | A VERY comprehensive book on Javascript. This Definitive Guide book is a classic. |
| **JavaScript: The Good Parts** by Douglas Crockford | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | _Another classic!_ Written by the inventor of JSON. _Empowers you to harness the true power of Javascript as a language._ |
| **JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development**by Jon Duckett | **[Buy on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/?tag=coursera-web-dev-20)** | **MY TOP PICK FOR JAVASCRIPT.** Just like his HTML\/CSS book, this one is very visual and gets to the point quickly. |

## Lecture 01 - Why not keep things simple?

## Lecture 02 - Why does code get complex?

* How it works without AngularJS

## Lecture 03 - MVVM

## Lecture 04 - AngularJS installation and first AngularJS App

* app.js

  * angular.module

  * .controller



* index.html
  * ng-app
  * ng-controller


## Lecture 05 - Sharing data with the view through $scope

* app.js

  * $scope.name

  * $scope.sayHello



* index.html

  ```
  ng-model

  ```


## Lecture 06 - Implementing NameCalculator example

* index.html

  * ng-keyup


## Lecture 07 - What's behind the "Magic"

* document.querySelector

## Lecture 08 - Dependency Injection

## Lecture 09 - How dependency injection works in Javascript

* $scope, $filter, $injector

* console.log


## Lecture 10 - Protecting dependecy injection from minification

* index.html

  * ng-blur


## Lecture 11 - Expressions and Interpolation

* index.html

  * ng-click

  * ng-src



## Lecture 12 - Filter

* app.js

  * $filter


* ng内置了一些过滤器，它们是：currency\(货币\)、date\(日期\)、filter\(子串匹配\)、json\(格式化json对象\)、limitTo\(限制个数\)、lowercase\(小写\)、uppercase\(大写\)、number\(数字\)、orderBy\(排序\)。总共九种。

## Lecture 13 - Creating custom filters

* app.js

  * .filter


## Lecture 14 - Digest Cycle

* $scope.$$watchersCount
* $scope.$$watchers
* $scope.$watch

## Lecture 15 - $ digest and $apply

* How to let AngularJS know when to refresh the View items if the items are out of AngularJS's monitoring watcher scope
* manually kick off

  * $scope.$digest

* notice angularJS by apply function

  * $scopel.$apply

* Use angular timeout instead of the javascript timeout

  * $timeout


## Lecture 16 - 2-way, 1-way and 1-time binding

* Best practice: limit your watchers number less than 2000 per page

* 1-time binding: ::


## Lecture 17 - ng-repeat

* index.html

  * ng-repeat
  * item in list
  * $index

* app.js

  * array.push


## Lecture 18 - Filtered ng-repeat

* Array filter

  * https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/JavaScript\/Reference\/Global\_Objects\/Array\/filter

  * array.filter\( function \(value\) {return true or false} \);



* AngularJS filter
  * https:\/\/docs.angularjs.org\/guide\/filter
  * &lt;li ng-repeat="item in shoppingList \| filter: search"&gt; ...


## Lecture 19 - Prototypal inheritance, scope inheritance, controller as syntax

* prototypal

  * The original object instance becomes the prototype for the all subsequently created objects.

  * Console output

    * Object: \_\_proto\_\_

  * function as object

    * test the example code for more details



* scope inheritance
* controller as syntax
  * html
    * "xxxxxxcontroller as ctrl1"



## Lecture 20 - Custom services

* controller 会根据需要创建或销毁，所以，永久需要用到的数据，或者多个controller需要共享的数据，应该放在service中

## Lecture 21 - Custom services with .factory\(\)

* factory 可以动态的创建 service

## Lecture 22 -  Custom services with .provider\(\)

* provider 也可以创建 service，而且在 config 中是可以注入 provider 的。这意味着你的service有机会在config中进行定义，配置，而具备很高的灵活性。

## Lecture 23 - ng-if, ng-show, ng-hide

## Lecture 24 - Asynchronous behavior with Promises and $q

## Lecture 25 - Ajax with $http service

## Lecture 26 - Directives: Dynamic HTML

## Lecture 27 - Restrict Property

## Lecture 28 - Directive's isolate scope "=" "@"

* @ - 将外部 Scope 范围内的 HTML 属性，和内部 Scope 的属性进行了绑定。绑定的属性是个字符串。

* = - 将 外部 Scope 范围内的 HTML 属性，和内部 Scope 的属性进行了绑定。绑定的属性可以是对象。


## Lecture 29 - Using controllers inside directives

* directive 可以拥有自己私有的controller，并丰富外部的 controller 。相当于对外部的 controller，针对特定的 directive 进行了一个扩展，而又不影响原有的 controller

## Lecture 30 - Directive APIs and "&"

* 相当于在内部构造了一个局部函数，去调用外部（父） scope 的函数。但参数的传递，是通过 键值对 完成的。

## Lecture 31 - Manipulating the DOM with link

## Lecture 32 - Using directive's transclude to wrap other elements

## Lecture 33 - Components & Component-Based Architecture

* start from AngularJS Version 1.5

* Component is a special kind of directive

  * assume some defaults configurations \(best practice\)
  * Components only control their own view and data
    * never modify data or DOM outside their own scope \(isolate scope\)
      * Modifying creates side-effects that lead to chaos




* Components have well-defined public API - Inputs and Outputs

  * Inputs: use '&lt;' and '@' bindings only
  * Never change property of passed in object or array
  * Outputs: use '&' for component event callbacks
  * Pass data to callback through param map { key: val }

* Components have well-defined lifecycle

  * $onInit
  * $onChanges
  * $postLink
  * $onDestroy

* Application is a tree of components

  * Entire application should be comprised of components
  * Each one would have a well-defined input and output
  * 2-way data binding is minimized as much as possible

* Implementation steps

  * app.js

    * .component
    * component controller \(not required\)
    * isolated scope named as $ctrl
    * binding inputs and outputs

  * component template

    * using **$ctrl**.xxxx as isolated scope properties
    * using binding inputs
    * using binding outputs to update to parent scope

  * parent scope html

    * Use HTML tag or attribute to to involve components just like directives



* https:\/\/docs.angularjs.org\/guide\/component - documentation for different versions
  * version 1.5.8 vs. version 1.5.9
  * $doCheck
    * It is a hook in $degist cycle
    * Example code: Lecture33-1.5.8
      \*



## Lecture 34 - AngularJS Event System

* send event up the scope chain

  * $scope.$emit


* send event down the scope chain

  * $scope.broadcast


* $rootScope.$broadcast

* $rootScope.$on

* To prevent memory leak

  * de-registration function

    * cancelListener = $rootScope.$on

  * call de-registration function when destroy

    * $ctrl.$onDestroy



## Lecture 35 - Modules

* Steps to use modules

  * specify other modules as dependencies

    * angular.module\('module name', \[\]\);



* Declare module artifacts

  * angular.module\('module name'\).controller\('controller name', controllerfunction\);

* Wire in the name of the main module in html

  * &lt;html ng-app='Main Module'&gt; ... &lt;\/html&gt;


## Lecture 36 - Routing

* ngRoute vs. ui-router

* steps to using ui-router

  * download

    * angular-ui-router.min.js

  * reference in HTML

    * &lt;script src="lib\/angular-ui-router.min.js"&gt;&lt;\/script&gt;

  * place ui-view initial view placeholder

  * declare ui-router as a dependency

    * angular.module\('App', \['ui.router'\]\);

  * configure routes in .config method

  * use '$stateProvider' and '$urlRouterProvider' in routes function



* ui-sref

* ui-sref-active


## Lecture 37 - Routing State with Controller

* define controller right in the .state, instead of the template

  * this will make the template more flexible and reusable


## Lecture 38 - Routing State with resolve

* we can use resolve to get some dependant async data before routing to the state

  * if we cannot fetch the data successfully, we can abort to route to the state
  * if we can fetch the data successfully, the data is ready before routing to the state, the end users will feel better


## Lecture 39 - Routing State with URL Parameters

* $stateParams

## Lecture 40 - Routing State with Nested Views

## Lecture 41 - Router State with Transition Events
